# CASE IFOOD

## Project Description

This is the final project from the Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp.
IFood is the market leader for Food Delivery via App in Brazil. 
The aim of this project was to implement predictive models in order to maximize a campaign implemented by the Marketing Team and increase profit.
## Steps

* Collect and analyze the data from IFood Case dataset.
* Clean and prepare data for analysis
* Analysed data using Tableau
* Used PyCaret to find out what was the best ML Model to be implemented.
* Used Decision Tree and LGBM as best Models for this case
* Used Tableau Stories for presenting the findings

## Results 

After using PyCaret to help to decide which Model was going to perform better in this case, I decided to use the Decision Tree Model and LGBM.
The results of Profit(Loss) and Coversion Rate were as follow : 

|   CURRENT    |  LGBM          | Decision Tree |
| :---         |     :---:      |          ---: |
|   ( 3,046 )  |     976        |      183      |
|    15%       |     57%        |      33%      |


Therefore, the best Model was the LGBM, increasing the Conversion Rate by 4 times ( 57% ) and increased the profit to 976, from the loss of 3,046 from the current Model.
